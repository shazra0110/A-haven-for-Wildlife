    "pmain": "The Wildlife Department was established in 1949 to manage the increasing number of Wildlife reserves and protect wildlife. From 1960 onwards, the Department of Wildlife Conservation faced challenges from large-scale development projects, such as the Mahaweli Environmental Project. Since 1993, a special project called \"Development of Wildlife Conservation and Protected Area Management\" has been launched to ensure the protection of wildlife resources."
