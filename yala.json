    "phistory": "In 1560, Spanish cartographer Cipriano Sanchez noted Yala in his map \"is abandoned for 300 years due to insalubrious conditions.\" Chief Justice Sir Alexander Johnston wrote a detailed account on Yala in 1806 after traveling from Trincomalee to Hambantota. On March 23, 1900, the government proclaimed Yala and Wilpattu reserves under the Forest Ordinance. Initially, the extent of the reserve was 389 square kilometers (150 sq mi) between the Menik and Kumbukkan Rivers. At that time, the reserve did not bear the name Yala. The Game Protection Society (now the Wildlife and Nature Protection Society) was instrumental in establishing the reserve. The forest area between Palatupana and Yala was declared a hunting site reserved only for the resident sportsmen.",
